# Conway's Game of Life

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ellsclytn/conways-game-of-life.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

**In JavaScript, no less**

## Requirements

- Node. Tested in 8.5.0.
- Yarn.
- A browser. Tested in Firefox Developer Edition.

## Running

I didn't bother with minified, uglified production builds, given the scope of this application. So, you can simply run the usual start script to see the result in the browser: `yarn start`. This will bundle all the things, so you can visit the result at http://localhost:8080

### Testing

- `yarn lint` to check for linting errors
- `yarn test` to run unit tests. No browser tests sorry :(
